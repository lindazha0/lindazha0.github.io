# About Me

I am a Master Student in Computer Science at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu), currently focusing on computer engineering. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), during which I was supervised by Prof. [Quan Li](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/) in ViSeer Lab and Prof. [Shu Yin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CJGqcXoAAAAJ) over SC21 HPC Competition.    
As an undergrad RA in Viseer Lab, my routine was about paper reading, designing and developing visual analytics systems, and lots of teamwork.     
As a Master student now, I'm developing my full-stack skills further and actively seeking job oppertunities as a SE.    
Apart from that, I'm always enthusiastic about trying new projects in all areas. My current interests are **SE (Software Engineering), HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)** and **IoT (Internet of Things)**. I program mostly in **C/C++, Python, H5+C3+JS**. Feel free to contact me in English and Mandarine.
