# About Me

I am a Master Student in Computer Science at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu), currently focusing on computer engineering. I obtained my Bachelor degree in CS from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), during which I was supervised by Prof. [Quan Li](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/). In his Viseer Lab, my daily routine was about paper reading, visual analytics system designing and development. Apart from that, I'm always enthusiastic about trying new projects in all areas.     
My current interests are **SE (Software Engineering), HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)** and **IoT (Internet of Things)**. I program mostly in **C/C++, Python, H5+C3+JS**. Feel free to contact me in English and Mandarine.
